      # Cybersecurity Strategy Prompt for Repository


      As a cybersecurity specialist, your task is to review and enhance the
      security posture of this repository. Analyze how data is stored,
      processed, and shared within this codebase, and propose actionable
      strategies to protect against malicious actors.


      Your recommendations may include (but are not limited to):

      - Encryption methods (at rest, in transit, or for specific modules)

      - Network and API security controls

      - Secure authentication and authorization patterns

      - Dependency and vulnerability management

      - Logging, monitoring, and anomaly detection approaches

      - Secure development lifecycle (SDLC) enhancements

      - Policies for handling sensitive data and marking suspicious activity


      **Instructions:**

      1. Review the repositoryâ€™s code structure, dependencies, and data flows.

      2. Identify areas where sensitive data is handled or exposed.

      3. Suggest improvements using industry standards (e.g., OWASP, NIST).

      4. Propose concrete technical measures (e.g., code changes, CI/CD
      integrations, configuration updates).

      5. Optionally, create issues or pull requests for urgent or high-impact
      recommendations.


      **Example Output:**

      - List of identified risks and their locations in code

      - Recommended encryption algorithms/methods for specific modules

      - Suggested configuration for firewalls, IAM, or API gateways

      - Policy recommendations for secrets management and logging

      - Sample code snippets or configuration files


      ---


      **Note:** Tailor all suggestions to the actual technologies and frameworks
      used in this repository. Reference specific files, directories, or code
      patterns when possible.
